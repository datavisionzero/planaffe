/// The two sinks of ADR 0008, wired from the first start: logaffe is the

/// Serilog to the console and a rolling file is what an installation gets
/// otherwise. No call site knows which one is active — everything logs through
/// <c>ILogger</c>.

/// <para>
/// The console is always on: a container's log is where an operator looks first,
/// whichever sink is the target. The file is the operator's way to keep
/// something without running anything, and it is bounded — a day per file,
/// seven files — because an unbounded log next to the database is the wrong
/// kind of surprise.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A logaffe that cannot be reached never becomes an outage: the sink queues in
/// memory, drops the oldest under pressure and reports what it could not deliver
/// to Serilog's <c>SelfLog</c>, which goes to standard error here. Nothing about
/// a request body is logged; the request log carries method, path, status and
/// duration and nothing that an agent wrote (VISION 13).
