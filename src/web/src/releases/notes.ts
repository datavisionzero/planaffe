 * A release as Markdown — what "copy as Markdown" puts on the clipboard, and

 * wherever it is taken from: the notes, a blank line, then one bullet per
 * issue with sub-issues indented under their parent.
 *
 * The instance orders the membership parent first, then that parent's
 * sub-issues, so the indentation follows from `parent` alone and this does not
 * rebuild the tree.
